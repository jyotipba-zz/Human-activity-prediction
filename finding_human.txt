Machine learning project on Human activity prediction

1) Problem statement : 

Given the feature vector, the goal is to build the predictive model
to predict the activity category of a human.

2) Data exploration

The dataset used for this project was acquired from UCI machine learning repository. 
Train dataset has 7352 rows and 561  columns (features) while test data set has 2947 rows.
Further looking into categories of human acitivity, there was 6 human categoires 
to predicted, thus making it multiclass classification problem.

There was no missing values found in either of dataset. 

3 ) Model building 

Three different models, namely, näive bäyes, random forest and support vector  
machine learning were bulding for prediction.  Support vector machine has 
highest classification acccuracy followed by random forest and naive bayes. 


4) Dimensionality reduction 

Two methods: principal component analysis , and feature importance from random forest 
model were used to reduce the dimension of data. And models were fitted again on dimension
reduced dataset. Using the first 65 principal components, support vector machine 
 and naive bayes were fitted and using 100 informative features, random forest model was fitted again.
Classification accuracy imporved with naive bayes model after reducing dimension, however
accuracy decreased minimally with SVM and random forest.
